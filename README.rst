:Info: A Python 2.7/3.x compatible Route53 module.
:Author: Greg Taylor


The ``python-route53`` Python package is a simple Python 3 compatible API for
Amazon's `Route 53`_.

Why not boto?
-------------

boto_ is a wonderful piece of software, one that I continue to contribute to.
However, we needed a Python 3 compatible route53 module, and boto has a long
way to go on this front.

Current status
--------------

Not ready for primetime. Don't let that stop especially motivated developers
from poking and contributing!
