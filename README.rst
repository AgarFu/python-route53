:Info: A Python 3 compatible Route53 module.
:Author: Greg Taylor


The ``pyRoute53`` Python package is a simple Python 3 compatible API for
Amazon's `Route 53`_.

Why not boto?
-------------

boto_ is a wonderful piece of software, one that I continue to contribute to.
However, we needed a Python 3 compatible route53 module, and boto has a long
way to go on this front.
