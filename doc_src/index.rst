python-route53
==============

Amazon's `Route 53`_ is an excellent DNS service, with great stability and
performance world-wide. The entire feature set is exposed through a web-based
API. However, said API is somewhat difficult to work with in some cases.

python-route53 aims to provide the simplest possible API for
`Route 53`_. It is also currently the only publicly available module with
support for Python 3 (also supports 2.7).
